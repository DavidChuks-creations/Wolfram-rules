# Wolfram-rules
Wrote java code to implement wolfram's elementary cellular automation rule
Wrote a driver class Lab32 which takes two command line arguments representing size and rule, creates an object of type CA and starts an infinite loop. Within each loop iteration the call to method getState() is made and the returned boolean array is properly formatted for output - false values are printed as black cells and true values are printed as white cells characters.
